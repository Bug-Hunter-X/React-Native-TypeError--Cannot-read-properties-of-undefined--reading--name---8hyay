This error occurs when you try to access a property of a null or undefined object in React Native. This often happens when you're working with asynchronous data fetching or when components render before their data has fully loaded.  For example, if you try to render `user.name` before the `user` object has been fetched, you'll get a `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'name')`.
